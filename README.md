# geospatial_coco

This repo contains a pipeline (currently in notebook format) to convert geospatial segmentation data into coco format.

Using it requires a raster, and a set of shapefiles representing the instance segmentations.

Currently, it is set up to work with the IVADO Laurentian tree data, but it can be adapted to other datasets with minimal effort.
